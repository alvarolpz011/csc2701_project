It is beneficial—but not required—for the academic\\nand industry supervisors to meet, so they can establish an effective plan to guide the internship work.\\nSelecting an academic supervisor\\nWhen selecting an academic supervisor, we recommend that students think broadly about who would be\\nsuitable for the internship project. Students should look beyond faculty they have met during the courses,\\nbearing in mind that faculty can be selected from the MScAC collaborating departments and faculties\\n(Cell & Systems Biology, Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Medicine, Statistics, Physics).\\nThere may also be suitable faculty elsewhere in the University.\\nOther criteria you should consider includes:\\n• Availability: Will they be available to meet for regular supervisory meetings and sign documents\\nwhen they are due?\\n• Collegiality and Interpersonal Relationship: Does the communication and work style match?\\nWhat will be the working relationship be like?\\n• Expected Internship Goals: What is the goal for the internship?
