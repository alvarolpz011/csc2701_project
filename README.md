## Problem Statement
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is one of the many techniques that the recent developments in the area of Natural Language Processing, specifically Larga Language Models, have made possible. Unlike traditionally depending on language models that rely solely on their internal knowledge with which they were trained on, RAG combines the generative properties of LLMs with information retrieval systems to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses based on real information. This approach addresses the limitations of  knowledge in LLMs by dynamically extracting and incorporating up-to-date or domain-specific information to their context. As a result, RAG has gained attention for applications in open-domain question answering, enterprise information search, healthcare, and more. However, developing and deploying an effective RAG system presents challenges that need to be overcome with effective ML Ops practices.
